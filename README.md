# PES-Final_Project
## This Project would play the Happy Birthday Tune at different volume based on the orientation of the board.

### When the board is flat to the surface i.e. 0 degree inclination ==> the volume would be 25% of the maximum. Peak to Peak Voltage is 870mV
### When the board is perpendicular to the surface i.e. 90 degree inclination ==> the volume would be maximum. Peak to Peak Voltage is 3.4V

I have also attached all the references in my report, and the report is in the same repository.   
I have included sample waveforms for low and high volume in separate folders in the same repository.  
The way I did my testing was mentioned in the report.
